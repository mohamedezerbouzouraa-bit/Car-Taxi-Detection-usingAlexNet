🚗🚕 Car vs Taxi Image Classification using AlexNet
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on image classification using a pretrained AlexNet model to distinguish between cars and taxis from images.
It demonstrates how a deep learning model trained on ImageNet can be reused for a binary classification task without training a network from scratch.

⚙️ How It Works

🔹 Load a pretrained AlexNet (ImageNet – 1000 classes)
🔹 Preprocess input images (resize, normalize)
🔹 Run inference on images
🔹 Analyze top predictions to determine whether the image represents a car or a taxi
🔹 Display the predicted label and confidence

🧠 Key Concepts Covered

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

AlexNet architecture

Transfer learning (inference only)

Image preprocessing pipelines

Model evaluation using confidence scores

🎯 Why This Project Matters

✔ Perfect for beginners in deep learning
✔ No model training required
✔ Clear real-world use case
✔ Strengthens understanding of CNN-based image classification
